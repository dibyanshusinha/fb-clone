# Facebook Clone and infinite scroll using REACT -- Front-End Coding Exercise

### Replicate the Facebook home page layout. 

## Page Structure

Like Facebook, the page should consist of a header, 2 sidebars, and an infinite content column:

1. Header: Should be fixed at the top and contain logo/text and navigation menu at opposite ends.
2. Sidebars: Should contain well formatted sample links.
3. Content: Should have infinitely scrollable content (posts). 

## Page Behavior

On mobile devices, only the Content column should be visible below the Header. The Sidebar content should be transformed into a menu, which should appear in the Header. The Content column should be full width.

On non-mobile devices, the Sidebars should each occupy 30% of the width, and the Content column should occupy 40% of the width.

Follow the same dimensions for width and height which are used by Facebook.

## Guidelines

Use Bootstrap and AngularJS or ReactJS to complete the exercise (briefly explain your reason for choosing one over the other). Follow HTML5 conventions.

This exercise should take a maximum of 2 to 3 hours to complete.


# Solution

Please check the website at https://dibyanshusinha.github.io/fb-clone

Facebook doesn't just follow the RWD design, it follows RWD + AWD Approach.

However I have replicated the effect using just plain CSS3.  
Time taken to build was around 4 hours. 




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
